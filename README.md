# Airline-Departures

# Estimating airline delay times
# Practice with OLS, ML, GMM estimation

# Utilizing airline.txt
OLS:
Delay = b0 + b1*Distance + b2*Departure_Delay + b*DoW Fixed Effects

ML:
Probability delay is greater than 15 minutes

# Utilizing IV.mat
GMM:
3 observed variables and 4 instruments (over-identified)
